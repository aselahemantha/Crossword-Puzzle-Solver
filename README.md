# Crossword-Puzzle-Solver
In this project, a C program is written to solve a crossword puzzle. The program takes inputs from the standard input, a puzzle grid, and a set of words and then prints the solved puzzle to the standard output.

Here, two main memory allocation methods are used to implement the code. Those are static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation.
